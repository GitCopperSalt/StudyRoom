    3) link                  generates a binary (library/executable)

    From a build ordering perspective, a dependent target B could just

    library generated by A.

    This object stores those paths.  To keep things simple, member
    variables only store concrete paths to single files, while methods
    compute derived values like "the last output of the target".

# A small discourse on paths as used within the Ninja build:
# All files we produce (both at gyp and at build time) appear in the
# build directory (e.g. out/Debug).
#
# Paths within a given .gyp file are always relative to the directory
# containing the .gyp file.  Call these "gyp paths".  This includes
# sources as well as the starting directory a given gyp rule/action
# expects to be run from.  We call the path from the source root to
# the gyp file the "base directory" within the per-.gyp-file
# NinjaWriter code.
#
# All paths as written into the .ninja files are relative to the build
# directory.  Call these paths "ninja paths".
#
# We translate between these two notions of paths with two helper
# functions:
#
# - GypPathToNinja translates a gyp path (i.e. relative to the .gyp file)
#   into the equivalent ninja path.
#
# - GypPathToUniqueOutput translates a gyp path into a ninja path to write
#   an output file; the result can be namespaced such that it is unique
#   to the input file name as well as the output target name.
